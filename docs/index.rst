octa |version| documentation
=============================

This is the documentation for The Order and Complexity Toolbox for Aesthetics (OCTA) version |version|, last updated |today|. 

The OCTA Python toolbox was created by Van Geert, Bossens, and Wagemans (2021) as a tool for researchers to create stimuli varying in order and complexity on different dimensions. 
It was created in Python 3.8 and is dependent on the following Python libraries: svgwrite, svg.path, svgpathtools, svgutils, jsonpickle, html2image, svglib, reportlab, colour, and IPython. 
We thank the developers of each of these libraries and of the Python programming language.
